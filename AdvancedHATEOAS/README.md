## HATEOAS and Content Negotiation

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/RESTful-API/blob/master/AdvancedHATEOAS/Images/ah1.PNG" />

Onscreen is part of a response from a GET request to the author's resource. We've got two fields, value containing the authors and links containing a self-link, which you see onscreen. The links are part of the resource body. 

That begs the question, **Is this really the correct place to put these links?**

If we think back about pagination, we talked about where the pagination information should go. We concluded that it's metadata, so it should be in the header. It describes the resource. And that's true for fields like total count, current page, and so on. But what about those next page and previous page links? We put the paging links in the response body and kept the rest of the paging information as metadata in the header. So are these links part of the resource or do they describe the resource, i.e. are they metadata? Same goes for the other links, links to self and so on. 

If it's metadata describing the resource, they should go in the header. If they are explicit parts of the resource, they can go in the response body. What we're actually dealing with here are two different representations of the resource.

With content negotiation, we ask through the accept header to get back a JSON representation of the resource. We ask for media type application/json, but what we return isn't a representation of the author's resource. It's something else. Additional semantics, the links, on top of the JSON representation. So the links should not be part of the resource when we ask for media type application/json. We've effectively created another media type which were wrongly returning when asking for application/json. So by doing this, we're breaking the self-descriptive message of constraint, which states each message must include enough info to describe how to process the message. 

If we return a representation with links with an accept header of application/json, we're not only returning the wrong representation, the response will have a content-type header with value application/json, which does not match the content of the response. So the consumer of the API does not know how to interpret the response judging from the content type. In other words, we also don't tell the consumer how to process it.

The solution is creating a new media type. So how do we do that? Well, there's a format for this, a vendor-specific media type. You can see an example of that:

```
application/vnd.marvin.hateoas+json
```
First part after application is vnd, the vendor prefix. That's a reserve principle has to begin the mime type with. It indicates that this is a content type that's vendor specific. It's then followed by a custom identifier of the vendor and possibly additional values. A good one to use in our case would be vnd.marvin.hateoas, as you see onscreen. Vnd plus my company, which happens to be called Marvin, the paranoid android from Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy books and then followed by HATEOAS, stating we want to include those resources links. Then we add a plus sign and JSON. 

What we're actually stating here is that we want a resource representation in JSON with HATEOAS links. If that new media type is requested, the links should be included. The consumer must know about this media type and how to process it. That's what documentation is for. If this media type isn't requested, so we simply request application/json, the links should not be included. 

```c#
    services.AddMvc(setupAction =>
    {
        ...

        var jsonOutputFormatter = setupAction.OutputFormatters
            .OfType<JsonOutputFormatter>().FirstOrDefault();

        if (jsonOutputFormatter != null)
        {
            jsonOutputFormatter.SupportedMediaTypes.Add("application/vnd.marvin.hateoas+json");
        }
    })

## Revisiting Media Types

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/RESTful-API/blob/master/AdvancedHATEOAS/Images/ah2.PNG" />

On screen, we see part of the response body for a book, requested with our new media type in the Accept header. There's two issues with this, first the format on the links. This format isn't a standard, it's something we're cooking up. The client will have to know how to interpret this format. And it learns that from the API documentation where we describe the custom media type, and where we describe Rel Values.

As we learned before, media types are also part of our outer facing contract. And then there's another issue. Hyper media allows the application controls, the links, to be supplied on demand. So, say we have a link to update the book, as we see on screen. How does the consumer know what exactly to send as far as the representation goes? We touched upon media types before, and we learned how to create our own media types. It defines the presentation of a resource. It's a central principle in the RESTful world. And we actually already have a great example we can use to explain this. 

Remember that we have different representations for getting an author and creating an author?

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/RESTful-API/blob/master/AdvancedHATEOAS/Images/ah3.PNG" />

When we get one, we get back an id, a name, an age, and a genre. To create one, you must pass in a first name and last name, a date of birth, and a genre, but no id. We just used application/json as media types for both of these, as most APIs do. But, in fact, these are different representations of the same author's resource. Using application/json is actually a mistake. That just tells us we want data format to be JSON. But we need to be more specific. 

So how do we correct this? By using media types. Instead of using application/json, you could create vendor-specific media types for these representations. An author representation to get can then be represented with media type author.friendly, for a friendlier format with age and name. And alt for the presentation to create can then be represented with media type author.full. And we can go even further. We could support different representations when we get an author. Pass in the author.full media type, would return the author with first name, last name and date of birth. We just learned how to work with these media types in the previous two demos. So, we already know how to support this. And this almost automatically brings us to versioning. After all, we are talking about an evolvable API. And that includes changes in representations.

## Versioning in a RESTful World

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/RESTful-API/blob/master/AdvancedHATEOAS/Images/ah4.PNG" />

We'll look into using different media types for different versions of input and/or output. 

Let's open the author entity. It's a shame, but people die, and so do authors. Currently, we have a date of birth, but no date of death. And that gives us faulty results. Douglas Adams, who is in our database. Well, he isn't with us anymore. And the age calculation is just wrong. What we're going to do is add a date of death field, for our authors in our database. And in the future, we want to ensure that when posting an author, this field can optionally be passed in. We don't want to break existing implementations though. A consumer should still be able to pass through an author without that field. For the sake of the demo, we'll just work with two possible classes for input. Let's start by adding the date of death field to the author entity. 

```

public class Author
{
    public DateTimeOffset? DateOfDeath { get; set; }

    ...
}

public static int GetCurrentAge(this DateTimeOffset dateTimeOffset,
    DateTimeOffset? dateOfDeath)
{
    var dateToCalculateTo = DateTime.UtcNow;

    if (dateOfDeath != null)
    {
        dateToCalculateTo = dateOfDeath.Value.UtcDateTime;
    }

    int age = dateToCalculateTo.Year - dateTimeOffset.Year;

    if (dateToCalculateTo < dateTimeOffset.AddYears(age))
    {
        age--;
    }

    return age;
}

public class AuthorForCreationWithDateOfDeathDto
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public DateTimeOffset DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public DateTimeOffset? DateOfDeath { get; set; }
    public string Genre { get; set; }
}

[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.All, Inherited = true, AllowMultiple = true)]
public class RequestHeaderMatchesMediaTypeAttribute : Attribute, IActionConstraint
{
    private readonly string[] _mediaTypes;
    private readonly string _requestHeaderToMatch;

    public RequestHeaderMatchesMediaTypeAttribute(string requestHeaderToMatch,
        string[] mediaTypes)
    {
        _requestHeaderToMatch = requestHeaderToMatch;
        _mediaTypes = mediaTypes;
    }

    public int Order
    {
        get
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    public bool Accept(ActionConstraintContext context)
    {
        var requestHeaders = context.RouteContext.HttpContext.Request.Headers;

        if (!requestHeaders.ContainsKey(_requestHeaderToMatch))
        {
            return false;
        }

        // if one of the media types matches, return true
        foreach (var mediaType in _mediaTypes)
        {
            var mediaTypeMatches = string.Equals(requestHeaders[_requestHeaderToMatch].ToString(),
                mediaType, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

            if (mediaTypeMatches)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}

[HttpPost(Name = "CreateAuthor")]
[RequestHeaderMatchesMediaType("Content-Type", new[] { "application/vnd.marvin.author.full+json" })]
public IActionResult CreateAuthor([FromBody] AuthorForCreationDto author)
{
    ...
}

[HttpPost(Name = "CreateAuthorWithDateOfDeath")]
[RequestHeaderMatchesMediaType("Content-Type",
    new[] { "application/vnd.marvin.authorwithdateofdeath.full+json"})]
public IActionResult CreateAuthorWithDateOfDeath(
    [FromBody] AuthorForCreationWithDateOfDeathDto author)
{
    same content of previous action
}

cfg.CreateMap<AuthorForCreationWithDateOfDeathDto, Author>();

services.AddMvc(setupAction =>
    {
        ...

        var jsonInputFormatter = setupAction.InputFormatters
            .OfType<JsonInputFormatter>().FirstOrDefault();

        if (jsonInputFormatter != null)
        {
            jsonInputFormatter.SupportedMediaTypes
                .Add("application/vnd.marvin.author.full+json");
            jsonInputFormatter.SupportedMediaTypes
                .Add("application/vnd.marvin.authorwithdateofdeath.full+json");
        }


```

Let's quickly build, and then, let's add a migration. That way, our database gets updated as well. We do that by executing the add-migration command in the Package Manager Console. So, we execute the command and we give the migration a name. AddDateofDeathToAuthor sounds like a good name. The migration has been added. If this is the first time you're using these migrations, well, once you call add migration, the tooling will create a class like this. It contains an Up method, which is code that will be executed when we migrate from the previous version to this one. And the Down method, which will be executed in case we would downgrade from the new version to the current one. So that takes care of that. But now we must, of course, also change the way we calculate the age. It's been a while, I think, from the beginning of the course, but we created the mapping from Author to AuthorDto, where we called into GetCurrentAge on date of birth, to calculate the age. It's this method, that we want to change. We want to get the current age by passing in an optional date of death. Let's open the method. We accept this new optional DateTimeOffset. And if the date of death isn't null, we set the date to calculate value to the date of death. That's it for the plumbing. Now, let's create a new class. Author for creation with date of death dto. This will be our version two class. It contains a first name and last name, the date of birth, the genre, and our additional nullible date of death property. Let's open the Authors Controller. We've got two headers that can contain media types, that we can possibly take into account. One is the Accept header, related to output. In fact, we already developed something like this, in our GetAuthor section. Here, we check the media type from the Accept header. We do that in the action. So, we use a FromHeader attribute on the parameter to make sure that the media type string gets bound to the AcceptHeader value. But, there's another header that can contain a media type. ContentType. The ContentType header signifies the input, an author for CreationDto. But unless you want to start working on object, we need to be able to accept two different types here. An author for CreationDto, and an author for CreationWithDateOfDeathDto. So, we need another approach. Let's add an extra action already, that accepts such an AuthorForCreationWithDateOfDeathDto. For now, let's just copy over what we have. We do have to somehow differentiate between these actions, depending on the content type header this time. And that's where action constraints come into play. These allow us to select an action depending on, for example, the content type header. In other words, we'd have an additional constraint on our action. Something along the lines of this, if the constraint matches, we can enter the action. Otherwise, we can't. Let's add a new class. We'll name that RequestHeaderMatchesMediaTypeAttribute. This is going to be our action constraint attribute, so we want it to inherit Attribute and IActionConstraint. IActionConstraint is defined in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ActionConstraints namespace. In our constructor, we want to accept the RequestHeaders to match, and the media types that will result in a match. But why use an area of media types? Well, we'll get to that immediately. But first, let's implement the IActionConstraint interface. That one contains an Order and an Accept method. The order property decides which stage the constraint is part of. Action constraints run in groups based on the order. For example, all of the framework provided http method attributes, used the same order value, so they're not in the same stage. And what we want, is for this constraint to run in that same stage as well. So, we returned zero. The Accept method returns a bullion, if we want the Route attributed with this constraint to be matched, it should return true, and otherwise false. So, let's implement that. We want to check if the RequestHeader to match contains one of the media types as values. So we get the headers. We can get to that via context.RouteContext.HttpContext.Request.Headers. If the RequestHeaders to match, for example, ContentType as input isn't found in the request, we return false. Otherwise, we run through our media types, and we check each with the value of the RequestHeader. If a match is found, we return true. If at the end, no match is found, we return false. And that's it for our constraint. On to the AuthorsController. Let's have a look at the existing action first. CreateAuthor. This one should stay as is, but it should now only accept application/vnd.marvin.author.full+json as ContentType. So, we pass in Content-type, as the as the RequestHeader to match, and we pass in our custom media type as the only media type in the media type list. Our new action then should only accept requests which have another media type as content type. This time signifying that the author contains a date of death. That's it for the action constraints. But there is two more things we need. Let's open the Startup class. This time, we need an additional mapping, so our AuthorForCreationWithDateofDeathDto can also be mapped to an author by AuthorMapper. Then let's scroll up a bit to the ConfiguredServices method. We added a custom media type for our HATEOAS links to the JsonOutputFormatters. This time, we have two new media types as input, so we need to add those to the JsonInputFormatters. We do that by looking for the JsonInputFormatter on the InputFormatters list, and if it's found, we add our two new media types, and support media types. And that's it, but let's go back, for just a minute, to the AuthorsController. We have our CreateAuthor, and our CreateAuthorWithDateOfDeath methods here. If we open the CreateAuthorWithDateofDeath action, well, that's still exactly the same as the CreateAuthor action. So, interesting fact, is that the action content itself, hasn't changed yet. Both actions contain the exact same code. Depending on how we write our codes, and what components we use, it will change. We use AuthorMapping for mapping, and that's not a requirement. Other frameworks, or custom code might not be so friendly. And we currently don't have any validation rules on an author. If we were to implement a custom rule, we might need these to be different. For example, the date of death, should be higher than the date of birth, and so on. So, it really depends on what other components and frameworks we use. But, this does add to the fact that creating different actions doesn't necessarily mean that we have huge amounts of code to rewrite. In our case, we could simply separate these codes into one method, and call into it. The additional effort to correctly work with these constraints, can be very minimal. Which really makes this a good option to consider. Anyway, let's set two break points on these actions, and let's build and run. Reading post mail, and we've got our first request here. The post requests two authors. It'll create James Ellroy. But, if we look at the headers, the content type is applicationJson, let's see what gives. We get back is a 404 Not Found. That makes sense. There isn't an action that matches this content type any more. Let's try sending another request. This is the exact same request, so the body still contains James Ellroy, but in the header, the content type is now our new content type. The custom content type signifies the original author. Let's send this. And we hit our break point. We hit the original CreateAuthor action. So far, so good. Now let's try posting a new author. The content type is now our custom media type, AuthorWithDateofDeath. And if we look at the request body, we see that we now also include a date of death field. Let's send this. This time, we're in our new action, CreateAuthorWithDateOfDeath. Let's continue. And we see that JD Salinger has been added to our database. His age was 91 when he passed, so our new age calculation also works as expected. And that's it for this demo. We still have one question to answer though. Why did we allow passing in multiple media types on the action constraint? Let's check that out in the next demo.
